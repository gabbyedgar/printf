# ALX Printf Implementation in C

This project is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how the `printf` function works internally and to provide an educational resource for understanding its functionality.

## Introduction

The `printf` function in C is a versatile function for formatting and printing output to the console. This project aims to recreate the core functionality of `printf` by implementing a simplified version.

## Usage

To use this custom `printf` implementation, include the `custom_printf.h` header in your C source code and call the `custom_printf` function with the desired format string and arguments, similar to how you would use the standard `printf` function.

```c
#include "custom_printf.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    custom_printf("Hello, world! The answer is %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```

## Supported Format Specifiers

This implementation supports a subset of format specifiers similar to the standard `printf`. The following format specifiers are supported:

- `%d`: Integer format
- `%s`: String format
- `%c`: Character format
- `%f`: Floating-point format (limited support)
- `%%`: Percent sign (escape sequence)

## Building the Project

To build the project and compile your code that uses the custom `printf`, follow these steps:

1. Include the `custom_printf.h` header in your source code.
2. Compile your program, including the `custom_printf.c` file.

```bash
gcc your_program.c custom_printf.c -o your_program
```

3. Run your program.
